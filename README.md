# Mars Clock
24-hour Martian Clock - Mars Sol Date (MSD)

### What It Does
Takes in a Terran Date `@da` and returns a Martian Date `[d=@ud h=@ud m=@ud s=@ud f=%~]`
```
> +mars-clock now
[d=52.635 h=22 m=35 s=58 f=~]
```

### Goals
1. Actually get accurate time and not manually add to match [Mars Clock](http://marsclock.com/)
2. Count your Martian age and next Martian birthday

### Inspiration
Inspiration: [Mars Clock by James Tauber](http://marsclock.com/)

### The code sucks
I'm learning how to write in hoon so if you have any better way to implement this, please do share it with me!
